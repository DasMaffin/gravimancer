You are a spaceship with a strong gravity drive and a magic pen. Your pen can be used to draw gravitational fields. A gravitational field will have the same gravitational pull on your enemies as you have. Use your forces to yeet your enemies into the bounds of the arena!

Controls:

    Your ship automatically moves to where you are pointing.
    Scroll your mouse wheel to increase/decrease the strength of your gravity engine.
    Click or hold LMB to draw a gravitational field.
